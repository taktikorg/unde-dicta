# @taktikorg/unde-dicta

A simple [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) node that integrates the versatile JavaScript library [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/), offering an alternative to Moment.js.

## Install
You can install this node via the manage palette option in the Node-RED editor or by navigating to your Node-RED user directory and running:

```

'2018-04-13 19:18'
1318781876406
1318781876
```
If the input is not parsable, the current time is used.
